We're writing summaries of academic papers that we have read, and roughly
categorizing them (using directories). Additionally, we're collecting the YAML
formatted citations for these papers, to make citing them in the future easier.

Contact us if you would like to contribute (either in organizing the papers,
writing summaries, or improving existing summaries). In general, we're trying
not to create new categories/merge existing ones until it's very apparent that
it should be done (avoiding premature optimization).

Reading a summary of a paper should not be mistaken for understanding the paper.
The summaries explicitely leave out much mathematical detail, and should be seen
as a "teaser trailer" for the paper.
